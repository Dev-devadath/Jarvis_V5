## JARVIS an AI robotic companion

Jarvis is a unique combination of artificial intelligence and robotics, designed to interact with the world in a way that mimics human-like behavior. With 17 degrees of freedom, Jarvis is capable of performing precise movements, gestures, and even tracking objects in his environment. His advanced conversational abilities allow him to understand natural language, respond to questions, and carry on thoughtful, engaging discussions.

## Features

- 💬 Integrated AI Conversations: Jarvis seamlessly blends natural commands with AI-driven responses, ensuring natural, dynamic conversations.
- 🗣️ Human-Like Voice: Jarvis now features an expressive, natural-sounding voice with emotional tones, making interactions more engaging.
- 🧠 Advanced NLP & Multilingual Support: With enhanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), Jarvis understands and responds intelligently to conversations. He also supports native languages like Malayalam, enabling better communication with a wider audience.
- 👋 Physical Interactions & Gestures: Jarvis moves his arms and body while talking, mimicking human gestures to enhance communication.
- 📊 Health Tracking Mode: In "Health Mode," Jarvis can measure real-time SpO2 and BPM values, providing basic health monitoring.
- 🖐 Sign Language Understanding: Jarvis now recognizes and interprets sign language, allowing for communication through hand gestures.
- 🎯 Face & Object Tracking: Equipped with face-tracking capabilities, Jarvis adjusts his movements to follow a person’s face. He can also detect and identify objects using AI.



##  What's next?

I'm working on a few key upgrades:
- 🚶‍♂️‍➡️Walking & Balancing: The ultimate goal is for Jarvis to walk and balance smoothly, improving mobility and adding to its physical capabilities.
- 🗺️Mapping and trajectory planning: Jarvis could automatically map and plan the trajectory and could be able to walk on any surface.
- 🤖Design: Give him a interesting body and redesign him.
- 📊MVP: I need to bring him up to a perfect working mvp stage.


## Support
If anyone knows the walking and balancing mechanisms for robots, I'd love to connect and get some guidance on it.
