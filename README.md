## JARVIS an AI robotic companion

Jarvis is a unique combination of artificial intelligence and robotics, designed to interact with the world in a way that mimics human-like behavior. With 17 degrees of freedom, Jarvis is capable of performing precise movements, gestures, and even tracking objects in his environment. His advanced conversational abilities allow him to understand natural language, respond to questions, and carry on thoughtful, engaging discussions.

## Features

- 💬Integrated AI Conversations: Jarvis can now handle natural conversations, responding dynamically in a human-like manner. It seamlessly switches between pre-defined commands and AI-based responses, making interactions feel more natural.
- 👋Physical interactions & Gestures: Jarvis now moves its arms and body during conversations to mimic human gestures. And could perform a wide range of movements
- 📊Health Tracking Mode: Jarvis can now provide realtime SpO2 and BPM values in "Health Mode".



##  What's next?

I'm working on a few key upgrades:
- 🔍Object Detection & 🎭 Face Recognition: This will allow Jarvis to identify objects and track faces, enhancing its interaction with the environment.
- 🚶‍♂️‍➡️Walking & Balancing: The ultimate goal is for Jarvis to walk and balance smoothly, improving mobility and adding to its physical capabilities.
- 🗣Human-Like Speech: I'm continuously working on making Jarvis' speech sound more human and natural to create better engagement.


## Support
If anyone knows the walking and balancing mechanisms for robots, I'd love to connect and get some guidance on it.
